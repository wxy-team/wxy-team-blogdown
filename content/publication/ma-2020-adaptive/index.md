abstract: "In this paper, an adaptive algorithm is proposed to do electromigration (EM) assessment for full-chip power/ground networks. Based on the eigenfunction solutions, the proposed method improves the efficiency by properly selecting the eigenfunction terms and utilizing the closed-form eigenfunctions for common interconnect with typical structures. It is demonstrated that the proposed method does trad-off well among the accuracy, efficiency and applicability of the eigenfunction based methods. The experimental results show that the proposed method is about three times faster than the finite difference method and other eigenfunction based methods."
